        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-2xl text-center">Ovotime is an open-source app designed to help scientists and bird enthusiasts predict the hatching dates of bird eggs&mdash;and to build a global, collaborative understanding of bird phenology.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">Why Ovotime?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">We&apos;re still in active development, and your participation is key to making Ovotime better.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>Request species you&apos;d like to see included.</li>
            <li>Submit your observations&mdash;especially if you&apos;ve recorded hatching dates for nests we&apos;ve modeled.</li>
            <li>Contribute data to help improve our prediction models and expand our reach.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">Your real-world observations are essential for refining our predictions and supporting ecological research. Every data point helps!</p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">One of the key benefits of using Ovotime is that it can help reduce nest disturbance. By predicting key stages of the breeding cycle, researchers can time their visits more precisely, minimizing unnecessary interference and improving the welfare of nesting birds.</p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">Ovotime is just getting started. Our long-term vision is to crowdsource phenological data for as many bird species and ecosystems as possible. We&apos;re also developing a hardware accessory that will:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>Allow users to photograph eggs in a standardized way</li>
            <li>Automatically calculate egg shape and volume without direct measurements&mdash;minimizing handling</li>
            <li>Include color reference markers to enable accurate data collection of eggshell colour for various scientific interests and applications</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">These tools will make it easier to collect high-quality, non-invasive data in the field&mdash;especially for small or sensitive eggs&mdash;and open new avenues for behavioral, ecological, and chemical research.</p>
